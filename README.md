# CPRD GOLD migrant phenotype validation

#### Project Status: [In progress]

## Project Description

* This repository contains the code, codelists and published ONS datasets from the paper [insert title](insert link) published in The Lancet Digital Health.
* The coding scripts in this paper were used to clean and analyse the data to produce the results outlined in the paper.
* Insert citation for paper and [insert doi](doi link)

## Data source

Data used in this study were provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). 
Researchers can only access this data through a direct research application to the CPRD Independent Scientific Advisory Committee. 

Comparison data referred to in the code have been provided in csv format, and can also be accessed here:
* (Office of National Statistics (ONS) annual country of birth data)[https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/datasets/populationoftheunitedkingdombycountryofbirthandnationalityunderlyingdatasheets]
* (ONS 2011 Census for England and Wales data)[https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs203ew]

### Requirements

The coding scripts were written in R studio and are intended to be used in R software with CPRD GOLD data. 
Additional R packages required are detailed at the start of the script.
