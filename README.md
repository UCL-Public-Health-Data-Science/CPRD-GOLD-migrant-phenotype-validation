# CPRD GOLD migrant phenotype validation

## Project Description

* This repository contains the code, codelists and published ONS datasets from the paper 'Development and validation of a primary care electronic health record phenotype to study migration and health in the UK': https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413304
* The coding scripts in this repository were used to clean and analyse the data to produce the results outlined in the paper.

## Data source

Data used in this study were provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). 
Researchers can only access this data through a direct research application to the CPRD Independent Scientific Advisory Committee. 

Comparison data referred to in the code have been provided in csv format, and can also be accessed here:
* [Office of National Statistics (ONS) annual country of birth data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/datasets/populationoftheunitedkingdombycountryofbirthandnationalityunderlyingdatasheets)
* [ONS 2011 Census for England and Wales data](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs203ew)

### Requirements

The coding scripts were written in R studio and are intended to be used in R software with CPRD GOLD data. 
Additional R packages required are detailed at the start of the script.
